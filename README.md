# Jarvis

## What is it?
This is a grand unified AI assistant for managing my life. Here are some things it will be able to do:

- Calendar Planning
- Advanced Question-Answering
- Service Integration
- Researching and Web Search
- Emailing, Messaging, and Calling
- Voice recognition and text to speech

## How will it work?

Not very sure yet. 

Some of the technologies I am thinking of are:
- OpenAI GPT-3 or GPT-2 (with finetuning) for advanced AI features
- Google Developer API for connecting to services
- OpenAI Whisper for advanced multilingual speech to text
- Selenium / Beautiful Soup for web scraping and research

It will probably have a web / cli interface. Backend will be written in Python most likely.

I may use multiple models, each has specific tasks.
